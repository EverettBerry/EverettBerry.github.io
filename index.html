<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to my webpage.</h3>

<p>I am a sophomore studying Computer Engineering at Purdue University.  
I plan to have links to projects and things I've worked on on this site, 
but I hope it will be a bit less formal than my 
<a href="www.linkedin.com/in/everettberry/">LinkedIn profile</a>.
Now I just need to find some content...</p>

<!--<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>-->

<a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>My Interests</h3>

<p>I like technology and I have been programming since highschool.
Currently I am thinking a lot about system design, databases, and programming in teams.
Most of this stems from a research project I have been working on for about 4 months.
More about this project can be found in the yet-to-be-created 
<a href="#">projects page</a> or at
<a href="http://bigdata.ecn.purdue.edu">the project website</a>.  I know C and Python pretty well
and I am in the midst of learning C++ and PHP.  I have also been playing
around with Objective C (who hasn't?).  As a computer engineer, my education focuses on low
level aspects of computers, and C is about as high level as we get.  I like languages though,
so I try to get involved with things outside of class that let me explore a little bit.
More to come soon!</p>

<!--<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
