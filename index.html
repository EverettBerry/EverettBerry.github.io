  <p>I am a sophomore studying Computer Engineering at Purdue University.  
  I plan to have links to projects and things I've worked on on this site, 
  but I hope it will be a bit less formal than my 
  <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/everettberry/">LinkedIn profile</a>.
  Now I just need to find some content...</p>

  <p>I like technology and I have been programming since highschool.
  Currently I am thinking a lot about system design, databases, and programming in teams.
  Most of this stems from a research project I have been working on for about 4 months.
  More about this project can be found in the yet-to-be-created 
  <a href="#">projects page</a> or at
  <a href="http://bigdata.ecn.purdue.edu">the project website</a>.  I know C and Python pretty well
  and I am in the midst of learning C++ and PHP.  I have also been playing
  around with Objective C (who hasn't?).  As a computer engineer, my education focuses on low
  level aspects of computers, and C is about as high level as we get.  I like languages though,
  so I try to get involved with things outside of class that let me explore a little bit.
  More to come soon!</p>
