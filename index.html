  <h3>Welcome to my webpage!</h3>

  <p>I am a sophomore studying Computer Engineering at Purdue University.  I intend to use the site as a portfolio of sorts for things I have done.  There is also a blog where I talk about all the hottest topics in pop culture, like software architecture and Purdue Engineering.  Feel free to contact me and Boiler Up!</p>

  <p>I like technology and I have been programming since highschool.  Currently I am thinking a lot about system design, databases, and managing big data.  Most of this stems from a research project I have been working on since August of 2013.  More about this project can be found in the <a href="/projects.html">projects page</a> or at <a href="http://bigdata.ecn.purdue.edu">the project website</a>.  I love languages (programming and otherwise) and I try as much as possible to broaden my knowledge beyond C, which we focus on in Computer Engineering at Purdue.  I am also learning French and (fingers crossed) will be studying abroad in France at some point in the future.</p>
