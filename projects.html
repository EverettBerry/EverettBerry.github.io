    <h3><a href="http://bigdata.ecn.purdue.edu">Continuous Analysis of Many CAMeras</a></h3>
    <p>CAMCAM is a research project I am involved with at Purdue.  Information about the project can be found at the link above, but essentially we are collecting and analyzing publicly available cameras (like traffic cams).  I am curently building the web app using django and interfacing it with the guts of our system, which handles the actual analysis of the data.</p>

For those of you who didn't go through first year engineering honors at Purdue, the robot project consists of a hellish few weeks of fitting Lego peices together and crying.  But anyway, out of all of that angst, was born this</p>
